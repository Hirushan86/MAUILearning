**MAUI Learning Application**
This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to explore and understand the workflow of .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI). The main goal of this application is to get familiar with the capabilities of MAUI, including building cross-platform applications for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows using a single codebase.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
1) Understand the project structure and setup of a .NET MAUI application.
2) Explore the UI elements, layouts, and controls specific to MAUI.
3) Dive into handling platform-specific functionalities and services.
4) Implement navigation, data binding, and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) patterns.
5) Learn about integrating .NET MAUI with backend services and APIs.

This repository showcases the process of building and refining a MAUI app, providing a learning reference for those new to MAUI development.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this as a base for your own learning journey!
